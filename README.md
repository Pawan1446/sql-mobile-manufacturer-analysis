# Retail Sales Data Analysis using SQL

## About This Project
This project is based on a retail store database. The main goal was to understand customer behavior, sales performance, product categories, and returns using SQL.

I worked with three main tables:
- Customer
- Transactions
- Product Category Info

## Tools Used
- SQL (MS SQL Server / MySQL)

## What I Did in This Project
- Cleaned and formatted date columns
- Analyzed total customers and transactions
- Found total returns and net sales
- Compared sales by product category
- Analyzed revenue by gender and store type
- Found top customers based on number of purchases
- Calculated revenue from flagship stores
- Used joins, subqueries, GROUP BY, HAVING, and CTE

## Skills Used
- SQL Joins
- Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Subqueries
- CTE (WITH clause)
- Date functions
- Business data analysis

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how real retail data is analyzed and how business decisions are supported using SQL.
